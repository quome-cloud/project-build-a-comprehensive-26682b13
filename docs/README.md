# project-build-a-comprehensive

## Overview

`project-build-a-comprehensive` is a comprehensive emergency management system designed to assist government agencies in coordinating emergency response efforts and managing resources during crises.  This platform provides real-time incident tracking, resource allocation tools, communication coordination, public alert capabilities, evacuation planning support, inventory management, reporting functionalities, and integration with external services like weather APIs.  Built with security as a paramount concern, the system incorporates role-based access control, data encryption, and audit logging.

## Features

**Core Capabilities:**

* **Real-time Incident Tracking:** Monitor and manage emergency incidents with location tracking and status updates.
* **Resource Management:** Allocate and track the deployment of personnel, equipment, and supplies across multiple agencies.
* **Communication Coordination:** Facilitate communication between first responders, emergency personnel, and government officials.
* **Public Alerting:** Disseminate critical alerts and notifications via multiple channels (SMS, email, etc.).
* **Evacuation Planning & Shelter Management:** Support evacuation planning, shelter allocation, and tracking of evacuees.
* **Inventory Management:** Track emergency supplies and equipment inventory levels in real-time.
* **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate situation reports, status updates, and performance metrics for government officials.
* **External Integrations:** Integrate with weather services, hazard monitoring systems, and existing emergency communication systems.
* **Secure Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure data security and authorization.
* **Data Encryption:** Protect sensitive data using industry-standard encryption methods.
* **Audit Logging:** Maintain a detailed log of all system activities for accountability and auditing purposes.

**Technical Highlights:**

* RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration with other systems.
* Asynchronous task processing for efficient handling of large datasets and complex operations.
* Modular design for easy extensibility and maintenance.
* Comprehensive unit and integration testing for robust reliability.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
* **Database:** SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM - easily swappable for PostgreSQL, MySQL etc. for production)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **API Documentation:** Swagger UI and ReDoc


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for production deployment)
* A code editor (VS Code recommended)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-build-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv  # Using .venv for cleaner project structure
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   Run the backend and frontend concurrently in separate terminals.

   **Backend:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

   **Frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.

2.  Build and run the application using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This will build both the frontend and backend containers and start them.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation at:

* **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

This section will be expanded with detailed examples once the application is further developed.  For now, the API documentation provides comprehensive information on available endpoints and their usage.  Key endpoints will include those for incident management, resource allocation, communication, and reporting.  Sample requests (using tools like Postman) and responses will be provided in the API documentation.
