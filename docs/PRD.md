## Product Requirements Document: Project Build-A-Comprehensive Emergency Management System

**1. Title:**  Comprehensive Emergency Response Management System (CERMS)

**2. Overview:**

CERMS is a web-based emergency management system designed to streamline and enhance the coordination of emergency response efforts by government agencies.  It provides a centralized platform for real-time incident tracking, resource allocation, communication management, public alerting, and post-incident reporting.  The systemâ€™s value proposition lies in improving response times, optimizing resource utilization, enhancing inter-agency collaboration, and ultimately saving lives and minimizing damage during crises.

**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Incident Management:**
    * Real-time incident reporting and tracking (location, type, severity, status).
    * Automated incident escalation based on predefined criteria.
    * Mapping and visualization of incidents on a geographical map.
    * Integration with external reporting systems (e.g., 911 dispatch).
* **Resource Management:**
    * Inventory management of emergency supplies and equipment.
    * Personnel tracking and assignment to incidents.
    * Vehicle tracking and dispatch.
    * Resource allocation optimization algorithms.
* **Communication Management:**
    * Secure communication channels between agencies and responders.
    * Mass notification system for public alerts (SMS, email, mobile app push notifications).
    * Internal communication tools (chat, forums).
* **Public Alert & Notification:**
    * Customizable alert templates for various emergency scenarios.
    * Geo-targeted alerts based on incident location.
    * Multilingual support.
* **Evacuation Planning & Shelter Management:**
    * Evacuation route planning and visualization.
    * Shelter capacity management and assignment.
    * Real-time tracking of evacuees.
* **Reporting & Analytics:**
    * Automated generation of situation reports and status updates.
    * Customizable reports for different stakeholders.
    * Data analytics dashboards for performance monitoring.
* **Integration:**
    * Integration with weather services (e.g., NOAA).
    * Integration with hazard monitoring systems (e.g., seismic sensors).
    * Integration with existing emergency communication systems.
    * RESTful API for external system integrations.

**User Workflows:**

* **Emergency Coordinator:** Incident creation, resource allocation, communication management, report generation, system administration.
* **First Responder:** Incident updates, resource requests, communication with dispatch.
* **Public User:** Receiving emergency alerts, accessing safety information.

**Data Management:**

* Secure storage and management of sensitive data (PII, incident details, resource inventory).
* Data backup and recovery mechanisms.
* Data auditing and logging.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  System should respond within 2 seconds for critical operations (incident reporting, resource allocation).
* **Security:** Role-based access control (RBAC), data encryption (at rest and in transit), secure authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT), audit logging, penetration testing.
* **Scalability:** System should handle a large number of concurrent users and incidents (scalable architecture, load balancing).
* **Usability:** Intuitive user interface, clear and concise information architecture, user-friendly navigation.  Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).
* **Reliability:** 99.99% uptime.


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**  FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), PostgreSQL (database), Redis (caching).
* **API Specifications:** OpenAPI specification (Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0) will be used to define RESTful APIs.
* **Database Schema:**  Detailed database schema will be designed during the design phase, including normalization and indexing strategies.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**  Specific APIs and SDKs for weather services, hazard monitoring systems, and other external systems will be identified and integrated.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Incident Management:**  Successful creation, update, and resolution of incidents; accurate display of incident information on the map.
* **Resource Management:**  Accurate tracking of resources; successful allocation of resources to incidents.
* **Communication Management:**  Successful sending and receiving of messages within the system.
* **Public Alerting:**  Successful delivery of alerts via multiple channels.
* **Reporting & Analytics:**  Generation of accurate and comprehensive reports.

**Success Metrics:**  Reduced response times, improved resource utilization, increased public awareness, improved inter-agency collaboration.

**User Acceptance Testing:**  Users from target agencies will participate in UAT to validate functionality and usability.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP:**  Core functionalities (incident management, resource management, basic communication, public alerting).
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  Functional testing, security testing, performance testing, user acceptance testing, documentation completion, deployment plan.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  System monitoring, user feedback collection, bug fixing, performance optimization.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Availability of necessary APIs and SDKs from third-party providers.
* **Business Assumptions:**  Sufficient funding and resources for development and deployment.
* **External Dependencies:**  Reliable internet connectivity for all users and integrated systems.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with third-party systems, database performance issues.
    * **Mitigation:**  Thorough integration testing, performance testing and optimization, robust database design.
* **Business Risks:**  Lack of user adoption, delays in funding.
    * **Mitigation:**  Effective marketing and communication strategy, contingency planning for funding delays.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Requirements gathering (complete), design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance.
* **Timeline Considerations:**  Detailed project timeline will be developed based on resource availability and prioritized features.
* **Resource Requirements:**  Development team (backend engineers, frontend engineers, database administrator, project manager), testing resources, infrastructure resources.


**11. Conclusion:**

CERMS will provide a critical tool for government agencies to effectively manage emergencies.  This PRD outlines the key requirements for building a robust, scalable, and secure system.  Successful implementation will significantly improve emergency response capabilities and enhance public safety.
